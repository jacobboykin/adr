## Context 
An architecture decision record is a tool for documenting important decisions along with the context and consequences of those decisions. 

## Your Challenge 
We would like you to put together a sample architecture decision record for a real technical decision that you drove in the past. 
Some examples might be choosing new relic vs datadog, or Kubernetes vs ECS, or a particular CI tool, or doing rolling vs blue/green deployments. 
Without revealing any business secrets, what was the context? What did you recommend and why? What were the alternatives and tradeoffs? 
We are as interested in what you recommend as how you document that for your team.

## How to Submit 
Please return to use a draft of an architecture decision record, this can be any document format you'd like that we can read. After you return this we will meet to discuss this in more detail.
